The project instructions are attached in GDL_PeakWeather.pdf
The same rules apply as for the other GDL projects, unless said otherwise. That means you'll also need to write a report, share your code, and give a presentation. Just like the others, a final quiz should be completed as well.
There are three mandatory deliverables in the document. Make sure to read the instructions carefully. Completing these, along with everything else on iCorsi, can get you the top grade.
There are also some optional bonus tasks. They can help you make up for any points you might lose on the mandatory tasks.
You'll find the data here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MeteoSwiss/PeakWeather. A library to download and load the data is available here: https://github.com/meteoswiss/peakweather.
A code base to get you started is available here: https://github.com/Graph-Machine-Learning-Group/peakweather-wind-forecasting . You can clone/fork the project and extend it if you want. TorchSpatiotemporal (https://torch-spatiotemporal.readthedocs.io) is another useful resource.
